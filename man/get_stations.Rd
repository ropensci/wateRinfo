\title{Get list of stations for a variable}
\format{
A data.frame with 10 variables:
\describe{
  \item{ts_id}{Unique timeseries identifier to access time series data
  corresponding to a combination of the station, measured variable and
  frequency.}
  \item{station_latitude}{Latitude coordinates of the station (WGS84)}
  \item{station_longitude}{Longitude coordinates of the station (WGS84)}
  \item{station_id}{Identifier of the station as used in the waterinfo
  backend}
  \item{station_no}{Station ID as provided on the waterinfo.be website.}
  \item{station_name}{Official name of the measurement station.}
  \item{stationparameter_name}{Station specific variable description.}
  \item{parametertype_name}{Measured variable description.}
  \item{ts_unitsymbol}{Unit of the variable.}
  \item{dataprovider}{Data provider of the time series data.}
}
The URL of the specific request is provided as a comment attribute to the
returned data.frame. Use \code{comment(df)} to get the request URL.
}
\usage{
get_stations(variable_name = NULL, frequency = "15min", token = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable_name}{char valid nam of available variable as timeseriesgroup}

\item{frequency}{char valid frequency for the given variable, for most
variables, the 15min frequency is available}

\item{token}{token to use with the call (optional, can be retrieved via
\code{\link{get_token}})}
}
\value{
data.frame with an overview of the available stations for the
requested variable
}
\description{
For a given timeseriesgroup (variable), provide a list of measurement
stations providing data. An overview of the variables is provided by the
function \code{\link{supported_variables}}.
}
\details{
For the moment, this only works for measurement stations of VMM (meetnet 1),
and stations from other measurement data sources are not included in the list
